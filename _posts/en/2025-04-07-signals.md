# Reactive Programming with Signals

How are you doing? Today's post is dedicated to reactive programming in Angular using Signals, where we will be reviewing concepts, techniques needed to implement signals, integration and compatibility with RxJS, advantages and exercises; as always the official docu [here](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)

## **What are Signals in Angular?**?

With Angular 16, a new way of handling reactivity is introduced: **Signals**.
These allow us to manage state more efficiently and easily, without needing to rely on **Observables** and subscriptions.

The **Signals** were introduced in Angular 16 as a simpler and more efficient alternative for handling reactivity. In previous versions of Angular, reactivity handling was centered around **Observables** and **RxJS**, which in some situations, could be complex and generate more cumbersome code. The **Signals** seek to simplify this, offering another, more direct, way to interact with reactive data (whether primitive values or data structures), avoiding also, the complexities that could involve subscriptions and the lifecycle of **Observables**.

## How do Signals work?

Signals** allow you to store and manage reagent values. Unlike **Observables**, no manual subscriptions are required. The **Signals\*\* manage reactivity automatically. When a value changes, Angular updates the view automatically.

To create a **Signal**, simply use the `signal()` function by passing an initial value.

```typescript
import { signal } from "@angular/core";

export class CounterComponent {
  // Crear un Signal con valor inicial
  counter = signal(0);

  // Incrementamos el valor del contador
  increment() {
    this.counter.set(this.counter() + 1);
  }
}
```

In this example:

- `counter` is a **Signal** that has an initial value of `0`.
- We use `counter()` to get the value of the **Signal**.
- To update the value of `counter`, we use `counter.set()`.

A computed **Signal** depends on one or more **Signals**. When the **Signals** on which it depends change, the **Computed Signal** is automatically recalculated.


```typescript
import { signal, computed } from "@angular/core";

export class CounterComponent {
  counter = signal(0);

  // Signal Computado que depende de counter
  message = computed(() => {
    return `The counter value is: ${this.counter()}`;
  });

  increment() {
    this.counter.set(this.counter() + 1);
  }
}
```

In this example:

- `message` is a **Computed Signal** that depends on the **Signal** `counter`.
- Each time `counter` changes, `message` is automatically recalculated.
- We cannot update `message` directly, since it is a **Computed Signal** (read-only) and its value is derived from `counter` (it is recalculated based on changes in the value of counter).

## **Advantages of Signals**.

1.  **Simplicity**: **Signals** are simpler to implement than **Observables**. No need to worry about subscriptions, cancellations or complex combinations of streams.
2.  **Performance**: Being more direct, **Signals** are faster and lighter compared to **Observables** when reactivity is simple.
3.  **Code reduction**: **Signals** require less code, which makes our applications more readable, scalable and maintainable.
4.  **Automatic reactivity**: Changes to a **Signal** automatically update the view, which simplifies UI management.

## When to use Signals?

**Signals** are ideal when we need to handle simple state values reactively, without the need for subscriptions or advanced manipulation of streams or data streams, for example:

- counters,
- boolean values,
- simple data structures that do not require mappings.

It is not recommended to use **Signals** when we are working with complex applications that require advanced reactivity, such as complex data combinations, handling multiple streams, transformations and data mappings.

## **Bonus: Integration of Signals and RxJS in Angular**.

In Angular, we can easily combine the reactivity of **Signals** with the power of **RxJS**, one example being, using two key methods: **`toSignal`** and **`toObservable`**. These methods facilitate interoperability between the two reactive systems, allowing us to take advantage of the best of both worlds.

Create a Signal from an Observable with toSignal:

The **`toSignal`** method allows us to convert an RxJS\*\* **Observable** into an Angular **Signal**. This is useful for example, when we want to use an existing **Observable** and handle its value reactively with **Signals**, without losing the ability to get automatic updates in the UI.

Create an Observable from a Signal with toObservable:

On the other hand, **`toObservable`** allows us to convert a **Signal** into an **Observable**. This is useful if we need, for example, a **Signal** to interact with other data streams in our app that use **RxJS**, allowing **Signals** to be integrated into an ecosystem based on **Observables**.

Over [here](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/rxjs-interop) I'm passing the official docu with more details about Signals and RxJS integration (I promise this time, it's not like the meme).

### Conclusion

The **Signals** offer us a more direct and simple way to manage reactivity in Angular. By removing the complexity of **Observables**, **Signals** become an ideal tool for projects and functionalities with simplified and optimized state logic.

For more complex applications, where we need to handle multiple data streams and advanced transformations, **RxJS** and **Observables** remain the best choice.

Happy coding!
